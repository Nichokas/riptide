### Installing dependecies

| Platform              | Command                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) | `sudo apt install mpv dbus libglib2.0-0 chafa` |
| Linux (Arch)          | `sudo pacman -S mpv dbus glib2 chafa`          |
| Linux (Fedora)        | `sudo dnf install mpv dbus glib2 chafa`        |

## Installation

### Automated Install

Download and install the latest binary automatically:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fezzik-the-giant/riptide/master/install.sh | bash
```

The script detects your platform (Linux/macOS, x86_64/ARM64) and installs to `/usr/local/bin`.

To install to a custom directory:

```bash
INSTALL_DIR=~/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fezzik-the-giant/riptide/master/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Install

Download the latest binary for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/fezzik-the-giant/riptide/releases):

```bash
# Linux x86_64
wget https://github.com/fezzik-the-giant/riptide/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/riptide-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
tar -xzf riptide-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
./riptide

# macOS x86_64
wget https://github.com/fezzik-the-giant/riptide/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/riptide-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
tar -xzf riptide-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
./riptide

# macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
wget https://github.com/fezzik-the-giant/riptide/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/riptide-vX.Y.Z-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
tar -xzf riptide-vX.Y.Z-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
./riptide
```

Or install to your PATH:

```bash
tar -xzf riptide-vX.Y.Z-*.tar.gz
sudo mv riptide /usr/local/bin/
```

Verify checksums with the included `SHA256SUMS` file:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

### Arch (AUR)

> [!WARNING]
> The AUR team has recently [disabled all pushes](https://lists.archlinux.org/archives/list/aur-general@lists.archlinux.org/message/YPJ3FQYJTJXXY3RUXCYLMHUKHLIUNVFF/). As such, the current version on the AUR is behind by several releases. The current recommended installation method for all users is to use [the automated install script](#automated-install). If you previously installed Riptide from AUR, remove it with `paru/yay -R riptide` before using the automated installer.

Riptide is available on the AUR and can be installed with:

```bash
paru -S riptide

# or if using yay
yay -S riptide
```

### Build from Source

Requires Rust 1.85+ and Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fezzik-the-giant/riptide
cd riptide
cargo install --path .
```

The `riptide` binary will be placed in `~/.cargo/bin/`. Make sure that directory is on your `PATH`.

### Nix

Tested on: `x86_64-linux`.

Add riptide as your `flake.nix` input:

```nix
{
  inputs.riptide.url = "github:fezzik-the-giant/riptide";
}
```

Then add it to your home-manager:

```nix
home.packages =  (with pkgs; [
    inputs.riptide.packages.${system}.default
 ];
```

A development shell is also available:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fezzik-the-giant/riptide
cd riptide/
nix develop
```

You can also run riptide directly:

```sh
nix run github:fezzik-the-giant/riptide
```

## Setup

Riptide uses Tidal's OAuth device-authorization flow. On first launch it will print a URL and a short code:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════╗
║           Tidal Authorization            ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  Open:                                   ║
║  https://link.tidal.com/XXXXX            ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  Code: ABCD-1234                         ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════╝

Waiting for authorization…
```

Open the URL in a browser, log in with your Tidal account, and enter the code. Riptide will save your tokens to the config file and launch immediately. You will not need to authenticate again unless your refresh token expires.

## Configuration

The config file lives at:

| Platform | Path                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------- |
| Linux    | `~/.config/riptide/config.json` |

It is created automatically on first run. Example:

```json
{
  "client_id": null,
  "client_secret": null,
  "access_token": "...",
  "refresh_token": "...",
  "expires_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00+00:00",
  "user_id": 12345678,
  "country_code": "US",
  "session_id": "..."
}
```

### Using your own OAuth credentials

Riptide ships with built-in fallback credentials (provided by the open-source [tidalapi](https://github.com/tamland/python-tidal) project). If those credentials are ever revoked you can substitute your own:

1. Register a device-authorization client at [developer.tidal.com](https://developer.tidal.com)
2. Add your credentials to `config.json`:

```json
{
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "client_secret": "your-client-secret"
}
```

3. Delete `access_token` and `refresh_token` from the file (or delete the file entirely) to trigger a fresh login with your credentials.

## Last.fm Scrobbling

Riptide can automatically scrobble your plays to Last.fm. To enable scrobbling:

### Setup

1. **Create a Last.fm account** (free at [last.fm](https://www.last.fm))
2. **Register an API account** at [https://www.last.fm/api/account/create](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create) to get your API key and secret
   1. You don't need to provide a description, callback URL, or application homepage to get your key.
3. **Add credentials to your config** (`~/.config/riptide/config.json`):
   ```json
   "lastfm": {
     "api_key": "your-api-key-here",
     "api_secret": "your-api-secret-here"
   }
   ```
4. **Authorize Riptide** by running:
   ```bash
   cargo run -- --lastfm-auth
   ```
   Or if riptide is installed: `riptide --lastfm-auth`
5. **Open the URL** shown in your terminal and authorize Riptide
6. Riptide will automatically save your session key and enable scrobbling

### Scrobbling Behavior

- Tracks are scrobbled after you've listened for **30 seconds OR 30% of the track duration** (whichever comes first)
- Paused time does not count toward scrobbling
- You can disable scrobbling by setting `"enabled": false` in the `lastfm` section of your config
- View your scrobbles at https://www.last.fm/user/YOUR_USERNAME

### Custom Scrobble Thresholds

You can customize when tracks are scrobbled by adding `min_seconds` and `min_percent` to your Last.fm config:

```json
"lastfm": {
  "username": "your_username",
  "session_key": "...",
  "api_key": "...",
  "api_secret": "...",
  "enabled": true,
  "min_seconds": 45,
  "min_percent": 50
}
```

- `min_seconds`: Minimum seconds to play before scrobbling (default: 30, minimum enforced: 30)
- `min_percent`: Minimum percentage of track to play before scrobbling (default: 30, minimum enforced: 30)

The actual threshold used is whichever is **less** between the two values. For example, with the settings above:

- A 3-minute (180s) song: min(90s, 45s) = 45 seconds
- A 2-minute (120s) song: min(60s, 45s) = 45 seconds
- A 10-second song: min(5s, 45s) = 5 seconds (no minimum enforced for very short tracks)

## Image Rendering

Album art and artist pictures are rendered using the best available graphics protocol for your terminal:

| Terminal                                   | Protocol       | Quality                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)  | Kitty graphics | Full color, pixel-perfect |
| [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot)     | Sixel          | Full color                |
| [mintty](https://github.com/mintty/mintty) | Sixel          | Full color                |
| Other terminals                            | Half-blocks    | Color approximation       |

The terminal is automatically detected via the `TERM` and `COLORTERM` environment variables. If your terminal supports Kitty graphics, it will be used. If not, Riptide falls back to Sixel (if supported), and finally to half-block characters as a universal fallback.

## Logging

Logs are written to `~/.local/share/riptide/riptide.log.<date>` and roll on a daily basis. By default, the logging level is set to `INFO` providing only errors and important events.

To adjust logging verbosity for debugging, use the `RIPTIDE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable:

```bash
RIPTIDE_LOG_LEVEL=debug riptide  # Verbose logging (includes all API requests)
RIPTIDE_LOG_LEVEL=info riptide   # Standard logging (errors and important events)
RIPTIDE_LOG_LEVEL=error riptide  # Errors only
```
